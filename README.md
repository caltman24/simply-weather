### APIs Used
- Forecast and Search API by <a href="https://weatherapi.com" target="_blank">weatherapi.com</a>
- Unsplash API for background image
- Geolocation API

A service worker is installed to support offline functionality. <a href="https://github.com/antfu/vite-plugin-pwa" target="_blank">vite-plugin-pwa</a> made this super easy to implement with vite.
All API calls are proxies with Netlify's serverless functions
